Game Development 2 Assignments:

1st week - 
* Brainstorm 3 challenges where kids take examples from http://p5play.molleindustria.org/examples/index.html and add functionality to them. Complete three "tutorial expansions" with a couple of feature add-ons each.
Example: 
Breakout - 
- add death condition if ball hits the bottom edge of screen
- make different colored blocks that speed up or slow down the ball, or other effects
- Add a new level after the first screen is cleared

* Then, write an outline of the steps that you would recommend kids use to build their first game. Get them pointed in the right direction.

* Finally, build your own game from scratch using the play p5 js framework. Something that is fun for a user to interact with.
