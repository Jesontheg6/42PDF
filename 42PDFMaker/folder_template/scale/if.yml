# Etiquette!
introduction_md: |

  Please respect the following rules :

  - Always remain courteous, polite, respectful and constructive during a peer
    corrections exchange. The quality of trust among our school's communuty
    and your reputation depends on it.

  - Should you notice any errors within the submitted project, 
    make sure you take the time to discuss those with the student (or 
    group of students) being graded!

  - Keep in mind that some subjects can be interpreted differently.
    If you come accross a situation where the student you're grading 
    has interpreted the subject differently than you, try and judge
    fairly whether their interpretation is acceptable or not, and grade
    them accordingly. Our peer-evaluation system can only work if you
    both take it seriously.

# Disclaimer for corporate partnerships with NDAs

# Technical guidelines
guidelines_md: |

  - You may only evaluate whatever is in the GiT submission directory of 
    the student you are grading.

  - Make sure to check wether the GiT submission directory
    belongs to the student (or group) you're grading, and that
    it's the right project.

  - If you haven't done the project yourself yet, read the whole topic 
    before starting the evaluation session.

# - Use the flags available to you on this scale in order to report
#   a submission directory that is empty, non-functional, or a case of cheating,
#   etc... In this case, the evaluation session ends and the final grade is 0
#   (or -42, in case of cheating). However, unless the student has
#   cheated, we advise you to go through the project together in order 
#   for the two (or more) of you to identify the problems that may have 
#   led for this project to fail, and avoid repeating those mistakes for
#   future projects.
