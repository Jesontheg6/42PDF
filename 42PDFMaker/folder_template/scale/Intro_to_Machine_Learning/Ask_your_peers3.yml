     Answer - Cost functions are used to estimate how badly models are performing. Put simply, a cost function is a measure of how wrong the model is in terms of its ability
              to estimate the relationship between X and y.
              Mean of the squared differences between predicted y and actual y (i.e. the residuals)

     How accurate was the answer provided by the student? 

     Answer - Learning rate is a hyper-parameter that controls how much we are adjusting the weights of our network with respect the loss gradient
              The lower the value, the slower we travel along the downward slope. While this might be a good idea (using a low learning rate) in terms of making sure that 
              we do not miss any local minima, it could also mean that weâ€™ll be taking a long time to converge
