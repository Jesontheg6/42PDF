  Please respect the following rules :

  - Always remain courteous, polite, respectful and constructive during a peer
    corrections exchange. The quality of trust among our school's communuty
    and your reputation depends on it.

  - Should you notice any errors within the submitted project,
    make sure you take the time to discuss those with the student (or
    group of students) being graded!

  - Keep in mind that some subjects can be interpreted differently.
    If you come accross a situation where the student you're grading
    has interpreted the subject differently than you, try and judge
    fairly whether their interpretation is acceptable or not, and grade
    them accordingly. Our peer-evaluation system can only work if you
    both take it seriously.

  Corrections are all about looking at the code together and discussing which,
  solution works best. So, you should

  - Run the program and see if it works. Does it hit all the right benchmarks?

  - Look at the code together and talk about how it works. Do they understand
    the code they wrote and can teach it to you?

  - Say hi to the other group and be friendly. Mark yes/no honestly to the
    questions below.

      Now, these built in functions are actually quite interesting and fun
      algorithms; converting between bases can be a fun math problem and an
      excellent coding exercise. If your correctee submitted a function that
      does the base conversion instead of using built-in methods, ask them to
      walk you through it step by step. Give bonus credit if they can explain
      it all. :)
