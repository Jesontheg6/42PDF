introduction_md: "\r\nPlease respect the following rules :\r\n\r\n- Always remain
  courteous, polite, respectful and constructive during a peer\r\n  corrections exchange.
  The quality of trust among our school's communuty\r\n  and your reputation depends
  on it.\r\n\r\n- Should you notice any errors within the submitted project,\r\n  make
  sure you take the time to discuss those with the student (or\r\n  group of students)
  being graded!\r\n\r\n- Keep in mind that some subjects can be interpreted differently.\r\n
  \ If you come accross a situation where the student you're grading\r\n  has interpreted
  the subject differently than you, try and judge\r\n  fairly whether their interpretation
  is acceptable or not, and grade\r\n  them accordingly. Our peer-evaluation system
  can only work if you\r\n  both take it seriously."

guidelines_md: "\r\nCorrections are all about looking at the code together and discussing
  which,\r\nsolution works best. So, you should\r\n\r\n- Run the program and see if
  it works. Does it hit all the right benchmarks?\r\n\r\n- Look at the code together
  and talk about how it works. Do they understand\r\n  the code they wrote and can
  teach it to you?\r\n\r\n- Say hi to the other group and be friendly. Mark yes/no
  honestly to the\r\n  questions below."
