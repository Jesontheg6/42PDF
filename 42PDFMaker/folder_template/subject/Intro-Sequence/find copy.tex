\chapter{Before you Start!}

Create your project folder:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item From your project page on intra, copy the git repository link. Now, in the terminal type "git clone " and paste the link. After the link and before pressing enter, write a name for the new folder. Cloning your git repository always creates a new folder.
		\item cd into the folder you just created and from now on, save your work there. Use the command "mkdir <name>" to create new folders. Put each puzzle from this project in a folder with the same name.
	\end{enumerate}

\chapter{Take a lesson online}

This one's a little different. I don't need you to turn in specific functions, but I want you to learn the language of \texttt{Regular Expressions}, or RegEx for short.\\

Regular expressions are universal to programming - they are used at the operating system level and are available in both Ruby and Python as well as other languages. They are a concise "search engine" which allows you to manipulate dates, times, email addresses, HTML, database inputs, password formats, and more.\\

Take the tutorial at \href{https://regexone.com/}{RegexOne.com} to learn about RegEx syntax. Make sure to read their lessons - you may miss some points if you just fill out the exercises.\\

\chapter{Prove your Skills}

Here's the challenge that you will turn in!\\

Go to \href{https://regexcrossword.com}{RegexCrossword.com} - read the 'How to Play' section and complete enough tutorials until you understand how it works.\\

Then, prove what you learned by choosing a challenge from the "Player puzzles" section and completing it.\\

You may want a pen and pencil for this, as well as a RegEx cheat sheet for reference :)\\

Take a screen shot of your solution and upload it to your Vogsphere repo. Your corrector will check that it's a valid solution and pop quiz you on the meanings of some of the RegEx expressions.\\

Here are some suggestions for RegEx puzzles on the easy side.

\chapter{Grade your work!}

Turn in your work by typing three commands in order: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item git add *
	\item git commit -m "<your comments here>"
	\item git push
	\item If you have an error during the git push, you may need to refresh your authentication ticket. Do this by typing "kinit <username>" and then typing your intra password.
\end{itemize}

Then, go to your project page and click "Set the project as finished".
Next click "Subscribe to defense" and schedule two peer corrections.
If you run out of correction points (check your number on your profile page!), it means you need to open correction slots and correct other people in return. :)
