\chapter{Foreword}

	Have you ever wondered what to do if your game fails?\\

	Here's some more interesting information my favorite failed video games.
	Let's talk about Ragnarok Online, one of the most popular 2.5d MMORPGs. Yes,
	this is the same development team called Gravity whose core members moved to
	IMC to make Tree of Saviors	(as you know if you read the foreword in the
	previous project). Why would we use Ragnarok Online as an example for a 
	failed game if the game was so successful?

	\begin{center}
		\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{images/ragnarok.png}
	\end{center}

	The main failure from Ragnarok is its sequel MMORPG, called Ragnarok Online
	2 (RO2 for short). It was a very difficult game compared to RO1 (Ragnarok
	Online, the successful version) since it went from a 2.5d MMORPG to a full-
	fledged 3d MMORPG.\\

	First, because the first game had been so successful the level of hype was
	incredible. Everyone was expecting a MMO to blow every other competitor out
	of the water. Second, it still had the same core team as the previous RO1
	so people were hoping for what made RO1 special would also be present in RO2.
	Lastly, the team had promised a lot of unique mechanics that no other MMORPG
	had implemented. This was all that the RO1 MMORPG players had dreamt of: a
	successful sequel that held the charm of the first game and introduced new
	mechanics that no other game could match.\\

	As you might guess they did succeed in implementing these new mechanics as
	promised. A combat system never seen in any other MMORPG, a unique world
	and leveling progession. Weapon and armor system was completely new,
	including how quest and rewards were handed out. So if this was the case,
	why did it fail so hard? The overly ambitious developers were driven to work
	so hard on creating a new experiences that they forgot the most important
	factor of Ragnarok Online 2: Gates of the New World - that it was supposed to
	build on the legacy of RO1. RO2 ended up nothing like the first iteration of
	the Ragnarok game, which left many fans disappointed in the world, the game
	and everything about it. The backlash was so harsh that the company was
	forced to make drastic changes. This including scrapping the ENTIRE GAME,
	replacing MOST of the developers and creating a new Ragnarok Online 2 called
	Legend of the Second.\\

	Needless to say, RO2: Legend of the Second is still alive today but it's just
	a generic MMORPG clone that focused more on bringing in the Ragnarok Online
	1 theme. The game is nowhere as successful as RO1 and most of the developers
	went to work on Tree of Saviors which is also nowhere as successful as RO1.
	In this case, the developers replaced their team and even remade the game to
	try and appease fans. It's quite a difficult time for Ragnarok Online fans
	like myself because the odds of these talented developers ever making a true
	Ragnarok MMORPG sequel are unfortunately very slim after their first attempt
	experience.\\

	Hopefully you learned a bit more about MMORPG games and the business of
	building them. There is much more information about this drama out there, and
	being a Ragnarok Online 1 fan, I followed everything on the RO2 development
	very closely. Needless to say the only thing that could fill that empty
	fanboy void is Tree of Saviors, or playing Ragnarok Online 1 again. Sadly, RO2
	is not worth it and does not live up to anyone's expectations. (I personally
	enjoyed the first Ragnarok Online 2: Gates of the New World MUCH MORE than
	the remade version).\\

\chapter{Introduction}

	The goal of this project is to create a boardgame with some simple mechanics
	for you and your friends to play. One of the main things you will be doing is
	continuing to improve on your object oriented skills, and working on reinforcing
	those concepts as well as learning about new concepts to help you make this
	project even better. We will explore a bit more about entities/containers,
	modules and extending class methods which Python and Ruby both utilize
	in their object oriented programming.\\

	\warn{
		If you are using Python or another language
		 make sure to research into language equivalent
		concepts on your own. This project can be completed in any
		 object oriented language,
		however the tutorial and video guides will be in Ruby.
	}

	So let's talk about how to make a boardgame. First, you need to create the
	spaces/tiles that make up the board. Second, you need to setup how you will
	display your board. Third, you need to work on a win condition. Afterwards,
	you will have to set up the players and any unique mechanics. In this project,
	you will be making cards/event cards for players to utilize as they progress
	around the board trying to win. It won't be as easy as the previous project,
	but you can do this!\\

\chapter{Goals}

	The goal of ft\_boardgame is to help you reinforce your object oriented programming skills.
	By the end of this project you should know how to:\\
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Extend class methods
		\item Utilize containers/entities
		\item Utilize modules
		\item Create multiple interactions between objects and classes
		\item Be even more awesome extra.\\
	\end{itemize}
	 
	You will be exploring a fundamental topic, object oriented programming,
	so take advantage of all available resources including the video, fellow
	students in the lab and Google. There are many tutorials on classes and inheritance.

\chapter{General instructions}

	    \begin{itemize}
		\item This project will only be corrected by actual human beings.
		You are therefore free to organize and name your files as you wish,
		although you must respect some requirements listed below
		\item Your must have a parent class and a child class (they do not
		need to be named parent/child, but it should be easy to see
		which is the childand which is the parent)
		\item A container/entity class is required for your project
		
		\hint{
			It will help you a lot to practice writing your entity/container
			first since they help you store multiple instances of object/classes.
			Create a container, store your classes inside and practice creating
			the behaviors inside.
		}	

		\item All child classes must be unique from one another
		\item You must have a menu/selection screen with proper loop handling
		\item You must allow the ability for people to create a player for the board game
		\item You can decide what variables you need for your board game
		\item You must display your boardgame in a GUI
		\item Your game must support at least two players
		\item Ask your peers, mentor, slack or anywhere else if you need
		any help, and enjoy customizing the design of the game according to your own style.\\
	\end{itemize}

\chapter{Mandatory part}

		\warn{
			The image example on this PDF are only examples, not what you need
			to replicate. You can design your output, your menu, etc. however
			you would like to design it. If you need help with design please
			visit the tutorial video guides as there is a demo there for you to
			see how the project should behave
		}

	\begin{itemize}

		\item The goal of this project is to create a simple boardgame project
		\item At the beginning of the program the users should be able
		to create a character or see a menu to do so
		\item One container is required to hold your multiple classes
		\item The container must be able to store your objects/classes, and delete them as well as access them.
		\item Your boardgame should be made up of tiles/spaces that are child classes
		of a parent class. Your tiles/spaces could represent anything from doing nothing,
		to giving players some kind of event or item (ex. move forward X number of spaces,
		or give a player a card that allows them to steal points)
		\item The players must be given an option to roll their dice, or play an
		item/card from their hand.
		\item You can choose to end the game immediately after someone wins, or have
		players keep playing.
		\item You must display the boardgame in some sort of GUI. This means
		you can decide on what graphic library you want to use for this. Below is
		an example of a simple terminal GUI output

		\begin{center}
			\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{images/boardgame.png}
		\end{center}

		\item You can design the player class freely as you'd like.
		\item You must have the player class equip/hold/contain the items/cards/etc that
		they can earn through the game.
		\item When a player uses an item/card/etc you must delete that item/card/etc instance from 
		your player or container.
		\item To really emphasize class interaction you will be required to do the following:

		\begin{itemize}
			\item A minimum of three items/cards/etc that players can earn from playing
			\item All cards/items/etc are unique child classes that inherits from the same parent class
			\item A minimum of three unique tiles/spaces that trigger some sort of event
			\item All tiles/spaces are unique child classes that inherit from the same parent class
			\item A container that holds all instances of your classes
		\end{itemize}

		\hint{
			Below is a sketch of what you should considering trying out if you are stuck and unsure
			of how to implement your classes in your container. You do not need to follow this outline, it is just here as a push in the right direction.
		}

		\begin{center}
			\includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{images/container.png}
		\end{center}

		\item You should try to make the user experience as enjoyable as
		possible. For this reason the GUI should be easy to understand.
		\item You must handle any kind of user error to the best of your
		ability. 
		
	\end{itemize}
