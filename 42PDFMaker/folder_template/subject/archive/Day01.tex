\chapter{Preamble}

Here is what \texttt{WikipÃ©dia} has to say about the otter:

\begin{verbatim}
Otters are animals that live near and around water. They are a part of the animal 
family Mustelid. A group of otters is called a "romp", because they play together 
and are energetic. They live in nests called holts. There are many different kinds 
of otters. Some live near rivers, some in the sea (Sea Otters). Otters live on
every continent except for Australia and Antarctica.

Otters are carnivores; they must eat a lot of meat to live, so they spend 3 to 5 
hours every day fishing and hunting. They can die of hunger more quickly than most
animals. They eat fish, crayfish, crabs, and frogs. They will eat any small
animals and birds they can catch. Much of their food is found in water. They dive
in rivers, lakes and streams until they can find a suitable animal to eat, which
they then chase. Once they catch it, they bring it to the top of the water, where
they eat it. If the animal has a hard shell, otters can use a rock as a tool to
break open the shell.

Otters are playful and energetic. They can be seen sliding down hills and slopes,
as well as chasing other otters for fun. Some kinds of otters live in groups,
while others are almost always alone. Because they spent so much time in cold
water, they have to groom their fur often to stop themselves from freezing.

Otters talk to other animals and otters with whistles, growls, chuckles and
screams, as well as chirps, squeals, and some kinds of otters might even purr.
They also leave their scent on plants to mark their territory.

Sea otters (Enhydra lutris) are classified as marine mammals. They live along the
Pacific coast of North America. Their historic range included shallow waters of
the Bering Strait. It also included Kamchatka, and as far south as Japan. They
have a rich fur for which humans hunted them almost to extinction. They frequently
carry a rock in a pouch under their forearm. They use this to smash open shells.
This makes them one of the few animals that use tools. Although once near extinction,
they have begun to spread again, from remnant populations in California and Alaska.

\end{verbatim}

It's a cute otter.
